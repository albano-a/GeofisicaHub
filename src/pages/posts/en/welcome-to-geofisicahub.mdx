Geophysics is one of the fastest-growing fields in recent years and plays a critical role across many global industries.

This site originally served only as a hub for geophysics materials, but why not expand it into a true reference for 
Geophysics as well? Any professional or student can now access this new section of GeofisicaHub to look up the meaning 
of specific terms, find conceptual explanations, and explore core topics in Geophysics.

The main idea is that each post explains the key concepts, discusses practical applications, and serves as a quick
reference for anyone who needs to understand a geophysics-related term or concept. The posts support mathematical formulas, images, and other resources that help clarify the content.

For example, below is the equation of a standing wave on a string fixed at both ends:

<Math math="y(x, t) = \frac{A\sin(kx)\cos(\omega t)}{\sin(kL)}" block caption="Standing wave equation on a string" />

This equation is important for understanding how waves behave in confined media, which has applications in several 
areas of Geophysics.

Below, we show an image illustrating 4D seismic acquisition, an advanced technique used in the oil and gas industry 
to monitor reservoirs over time:

/>

Each post will include references at the end, when necessary, so readers can verify the information presented. This one has
one as an example. The goal is to build a reliable and trustworthy knowledge base for everyone interested in Geophysics.

Also, there is a new PDF viewer for the books. The user can now read books directly on the site without needing 
to download them.
