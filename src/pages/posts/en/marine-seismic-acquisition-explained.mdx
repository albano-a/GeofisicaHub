Seismic acquisition is one of the most important steps in hydrocarbon exploration. It is the process of collecting seismic data to create images of what lies beneath the Earth's surface. These images help scientists and engineers understand underground structures and decide where drilling can be done safely and efficiently.

There are different seismic acquisition methods used on land and at sea. In this article, we focus on **offshore (marine) seismic acquisition**.

## Marine Acoustic Methods

Marine geophysical surveys are carried out to study the shape of the seafloor, the structure of subsurface sediments, and how these environments change over time. They are also essential for exploring offshore mineral and energy resources.

The most common marine survey methods include:

* Seismic surveys
* Gravity and magnetic surveys
* Heat flow measurements
* High-resolution acoustic techniques such as bathymetry, side-scan sonar, and sub-bottom profiling

Before drilling an offshore well, engineers must understand both the seafloor topography and the types of sediments below it near the planned well location. This process is called a **site survey**.

Marine site surveys use instruments that emit sound waves into the water and seafloor and record the returning signals. The method chosen depends on:

* What information is needed
* How detailed the data must be
* How deep the signals need to penetrate

Low-frequency sound waves, commonly used in seismic surveys, are generated by air guns or spark sources. These waves can travel deep into the subsurface and reveal large geological structures.

Higher-frequency sound waves are produced by instruments called **transducers**. These are mainly used to study the water column and shallow sediments in much greater detail. Transducers work using piezoelectric ceramic crystals that vibrate when an electric pulse is applied, producing sound waves.

The most important parameter in high-resolution marine surveys is **signal frequency**. Frequency directly controls two key factors:

* **Resolution**: how clearly small features can be seen
* **Penetration depth**: how deep the signal can travel

Higher frequencies provide sharper and more detailed images but penetrate only shallow layers. Lower frequencies reach deeper into the subsurface but produce less detailed images. For this reason, different acoustic systems are chosen depending on whether the goal is deep exploration or detailed mapping of shallow sediments.

## Fundamentals of Marine Seismics

### Seismic Waves
Seismic waves are often termed elastic waves, which can be described as the energy caused by a sudden breaking of rock within the earth, such as from earthquakes, or explosions, such as from the sources in seismic surveys. They can travel in air and in solid or liquid materials, e.g., through the earth's interior or within the oceans. The particles during the wave energy passage are successively compressed and pulled apart, or they perform a lateral movement, depending on the elastic wave type they are affected by.

Seismic waves propagate in an expanding spherical shape in a homogeneous medium after they are generated by an explosive source in seismic surveys, such as the expanding spherical waves formed by a pebble thrown into a calm water. This frontal energy is termed the wave front. The direction perpendicular to any point on the wave front is named the ray path. There are two main seismic waves generated by seismic sources as well as earthquakes, named body waves and surface waves. Body waves are of higher frequency and propagation velocity than surface waves.

There are two types of body waves, named primary (P) waves and secondary (S) waves. Both can penetrate into the earth through the deeper layes. P waves are faster than S waves and arrive at the seismometers first, followed by S waves, during an earthquake. That's why we call them primary and secondary waves, respectively. P waves can travel in solids such as rocks and sediments of the subsurface, liquids such as the water column of the oceans, and gasses. Particles affected by P waves move in the same direction, parallel to the ray path that the wave propagates on. The velocity of the P waves can be expressed by elastic constants of the propagating medium, as 

<Math math="V_p = \sqrt{\frac{k + \frac{4}{3}\mu}{\rho}}" block={true} />

where <Math math="k" /> is the bulk modulus, <Math math="\mu" /> is the rigidity or shear modulus, and <Math math="\rho" /> is the density of the medium. S waves can only travel in solids. Particles affected by S waves move perpendicular to the ray path that the wave propagates on. The velocity of the S waves can be expressed by elastic constants of the propagating medium as

<Math math="V_s = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\rho}}" block={true} />

where <Math math="\mu" /> is the rigidity or shear modulus, and <Math math="\rho" /> is the density. Velocity of S waves is always slower than P waves.

The second type of seismic wave is the surface wave, which propagates at the free surface of a medium such as the earth's surface. They can be divided into two types, called Rayleigh (R) waves and Love (L) waves, which are distinguished by their different types of particle motions.

P waves are the major seismic wave type used in seismic exploration both in land and marine seismic acquisition. S wave velocity depends on rigidity modulus and the density of the propagating medium. Since rigidity is zero in liquids, S waves do not propagate in water, and therefore explorations by S waves are not common in marine seismics. Howerver, it is possible to record S waves using ocean bottom cables (OBCs), ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs), or seabed nodes in marine surveys, which can provide four-component (4C) seismic data.
