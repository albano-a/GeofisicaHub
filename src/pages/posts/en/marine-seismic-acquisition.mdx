Seismic acquisition is one of the most important stages in hydrocarbon exploration. It is the process of collecting seismic data to generate images of what lies beneath the Earth’s surface. These images allow scientists and engineers to understand subsurface structures and to decide where drilling can be carried out safely and efficiently.

Different seismic acquisition methods are used on land and at sea. In this text, the focus is on **offshore (marine) seismic acquisition**.

## Marine Acoustic Methods

Marine geophysical surveys are performed to study the shape of the seafloor, the structure of subsurface sediments, and how these environments evolve over time. They are also essential for the exploration of offshore mineral and energy resources.

The most common marine survey methods include:

* Seismic surveys
* Gravity and magnetic surveys
* Heat flow measurements
* High-resolution acoustic techniques such as bathymetry, side-scan sonar, and sub-bottom profiling

Before drilling an offshore well, engineers must understand both the seafloor topography and the sedimentary layers beneath the planned well location. This process is known as a **site survey**.

Marine site surveys use instruments that emit sound waves into the water and the seafloor and then record the returning signals. The choice of method depends on:

* The type of information required
* The level of detail needed
* The depth that the signal must reach

Low-frequency sound waves, commonly used in seismic surveys, are generated by air guns or spark sources. These waves can penetrate deep into the subsurface and reveal large-scale geological structures.

Higher-frequency sound waves are produced by instruments called **transducers**. These are mainly used to investigate the water column and shallow sediments with much higher detail. Transducers operate using piezoelectric ceramic crystals that vibrate when an electric pulse is applied, producing sound waves.

The most important parameter in high-resolution marine surveys is **signal frequency**. Frequency directly controls two key factors:

* **Resolution**, which defines how clearly small features can be distinguished
* **Penetration depth**, which defines how deep the signal can travel

High frequencies produce sharper and more detailed images but penetrate only shallow layers. Low frequencies reach deeper into the subsurface but generate images with lower resolution. For this reason, different acoustic systems are selected depending on whether the objective is deep exploration or detailed mapping of shallow sediments.

## Fundamentals of Marine Seismics

### Seismic Waves

Seismic waves are energy that travels through the Earth after a sudden event. This event can be natural, such as an earthquake, or artificial, such as the acoustic sources used in seismic surveys. These waves propagate through solids, liquids, and gases. As they pass through a medium, particles are compressed and expanded or move sideways, depending on the wave type.

When a seismic source is activated in a uniform medium, the energy spreads outward in all directions, similar to ripples created by a stone dropped into calm water. This expanding surface is called the **wave front**. The direction perpendicular to the wave front is known as the **ray path**.

Seismic waves are grouped into two main categories: **body waves** and **surface waves**. Body waves travel faster and provide most of the useful information for seismic exploration. Surface waves remain near the Earth’s surface and are usually treated as noise in exploration data.

There are two types of body waves: **P waves** (primary) and **S waves** (secondary). Both can travel deep into the Earth. P waves move faster and therefore arrive first at the receivers, while S waves arrive later. This difference in arrival time is a fundamental concept in seismology.

P waves can propagate through solids, liquids, and gases. The particle motion occurs in the same direction as wave propagation. Their velocity depends on the stiffness and density of the medium and can be expressed as

<Math f="V_p = \sqrt{\frac{k + \frac{4}{3}\mu}{\rho}}" block />

where <Math f="k" /> is the bulk modulus, <Math f="\mu" /> is the shear modulus, and <Math f="\rho" /> is the density of the medium.

S waves behave differently. They can propagate only through solids. Particle motion is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, similar to the motion of a shaken rope. Their velocity is given by

<Math f="V_s = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\rho}}" block />

where <Math f="\mu" /> is the shear modulus and <Math f="\rho" /> is the density. S waves are always slower than P waves.

The second main class of seismic waves is **surface waves**, which propagate along the free surface of the Earth. They are divided into **Rayleigh (R)** waves and **Love (L)** waves according to their particle motion. These waves carry strong energy but usually interfere with seismic exploration data rather than contribute useful information.

In seismic exploration, especially in marine surveys, **P waves are the primary wave type used**. They propagate efficiently through water and sediments and produce clear images of the subsurface. S waves depend on rigidity, and because water has no rigidity, S waves cannot propagate in the ocean. For this reason, traditional marine seismic surveys rarely rely on S waves.

However, modern systems such as ocean bottom cables, ocean bottom seismometers, and seabed nodes can record S waves indirectly. These systems generate **four-component (4C) seismic data**, which provide more complete information about rock properties and reservoir behavior.


### Reflection from an Interface
When the compressional wave strikes an interface separating two media with *different propagation velocities and densities*, some certain part of the incident energy is reflected from the boundary back into the upper medium, while the remaining part is transmitted into teh underlying media. Seismic waves are reflected from the interfaces that separate two media of different acoustic impedances defined by:

<Math f="Z = \rho V" block />

where <Math f="Z" /> is the acoustic impedance, <Math f="\rho" /> is density, and <Math f="V" /> is the velocity of the medium.

The reflection coefficient of a given interface is

<Math f="R = \frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_2 + Z_1}" block />

and the transmission coefficient is

<Math f="T = \frac{2Z_1}{Z_2 + Z_1}" block />

where <Math f="Z_1" /> and <Math f="Z_2" /> are the acoustic impedances of the upper and lower media, respectively. The amplitude of the reflected portion of the incident wave is <Math f="A_r = R \cdot A_0" /> and the transmitted wave amplitude is <Math f="A_t = T \cdot A_0" /> where <Math f="A_0" /> is the amplitude of the incident wave. The sum of the reflected and trasnmitted amplitude equals to the incident wave amplitude.
