## Overview

When I enrolled in the Geophysics course after discovering it literally on the day of SISU registrations, I had no clue what Geophysics was. And even today, many people don't know what Geophysics is. This website is an attempt to change that. The website is directed towards geophysics students and professionals, but it can be used by anyone who wants to learn more about Geophysics. It contains study materials, calculators, and links to various databases and articles. The website is still in development, and I plan to add more features in the future. If you want to contribute, feel free to do so.

## Features

- Access study materials from the top 5 study areas: Geophysics, Geology, Calculus, Physics, and Programming.
- Access various calculators, from simple ones to calculators for rock physical properties and seismic calculations.
- Access various links and article databases.

## Prerequisites

None. Just open the website and use it.

## Installation

No need to install anything.

## How to Use

- Access [GeofisicaHub](https://geofisicahub.com/).
- Navigate through the site and use the available tools.
- If you encounter any issues, contact me through the 'Contact' tab.

## Contribution

If you want to contribute to the project, feel free to do so opening a pull request.
